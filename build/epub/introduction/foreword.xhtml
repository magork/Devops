<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>This book was a mistake, I was using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sphinx</span></code> documentation package to make my training readable, by mistake instead of building the documentation for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HTML</span></code> I used <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">epub</span></code>. It hit me, I ought to write a book, so I did.</p>
<p>As part of the technology industry, I have seen firsthand the power of DevOps in transforming the way software is developed and delivered. It is a true game-changer for organizations of all sizes and industries.</p>
<p>DevOps is a holistic approach that combines software development and IT operations to create a culture of collaboration and automation. It enables teams to deliver software faster, with higher quality and reliability, while also reducing risks and improving the overall performance and security of the software.</p>
<p>This book is a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn about DevOps and its principles. It provides a comprehensive introduction to the topic, covering everything from the basics to the most advanced concepts and tools. I’ve tried explaining the challenges that organizations face when implementing DevOps, and providing practical tips and techniques for overcoming them.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about DevOps, whether you are a developer, an operations engineer, or just someone interested in the topic. It is a great resource for individuals and teams looking to improve their software development process and stay competitive in today’s fast-paced digital world.</p>
<p>Should you master everything? That’s not possible, when you’re done becoming an expert, new technologies that will be a game changer will appear. A skilled DevOps engineer is a “jack of all trade master of one”, so focus on getting better at one technology.</p>
<p>I am confident that the knowledge and insights shared in this book will help you to successfully implement DevOps in your organization and achieve your business goals. Happy reading!</p>
