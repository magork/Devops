<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>Welcome to the world of DevOps! This book is designed to introduce you to the concepts and practices of DevOps and to help you understand how it can be used to improve the performance, reliability, and security of your software development projects.</p>
<p>DevOps is an approach that combines software development and IT operations to create a culture of collaboration and automation. It aims to bring the two sides of the software development process - development and operations - together to improve the speed and quality of software delivery.</p>
<p>In this book, you will learn about the key principles and practices of DevOps, such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code. You will also learn about the tools and technologies that are commonly used in DevOps, such as Linux, Git, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible.</p>
