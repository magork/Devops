<p>CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines are a set of automated processes that are used to build, test, and deploy software changes. The goal of these pipelines is to automate the software delivery process and to ensure that changes are delivered to production quickly and safely.</p>
</div>
<p>CI (Continuous Integration) is the process of automatically building and testing code changes as soon as they are committed to the source code repository. This allows developers to catch and fix errors early in the development process before they become more difficult to fix.</p>
<p>CD (Continuous Deployment) is the process of automatically deploying code changes to production as soon as they pass all of the necessary tests and quality checks. This allows organizations to deliver changes to customers faster and with less risk.</p>
<p>A typical CI/CD pipeline includes the following stages:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Build</strong>: Compile the code and create the executable or deployable artifact</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Test</strong>: Automated testing of the code, including unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deploy</strong>: Deploy the code to a staging environment for further testing and validation</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Release</strong>: Release the code to production</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitor</strong>: Monitor the performance and stability of the deployed code in production</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>CI/CD pipelines can be integrated with a variety of tools, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitLab CI/CD, to automate the different stages of the pipeline, and can also be integrated with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP.</p>
<p>CI/CD pipelines are a key tool for organizations that want to deliver software changes quickly and safely, and they can help organizations to improve the quality and reliability of their software while also reducing the time and cost of software delivery.</p>
