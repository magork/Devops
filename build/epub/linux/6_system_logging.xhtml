<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Log files are files that contain messages about the system, including the kernel, services, and applications running on it.</p>
</div>
<p>There are different log files for different information. For example, there is a default system log file, a log file just for security messages, and a log file for cron tasks. Everything from kernel events to user actions can be logged, allowing you to see almost any action performed on your servers.</p>
<p>Log files can be very useful when trying to troubleshoot a problem with the system such as trying to start a service or when looking for unauthorized login attempts to the system.</p>
<p>In RHEL log files are controlled by a daemon called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rsyslogd</span></code>.</p>
<section id="linux-system-logs">
<h2>Linux System Logs</h2>
<p>Linux has a special directory for storing logs called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/var/log</span></code>.</p>
<p>This directory contains logs from the OS itself, services, and various applications running on the system.</p>
<p>Some of the most important Linux system logs include</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/var/log/messages</span></code> stores all global system activity data, including startup messages</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/var/log/secure</span></code> stores all security-related events such as logins, root user actions, and output from pluggable authentication modules (PAM)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/var/log/cron</span></code> stores information about scheduled tasks (cron jobs)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/var/log/maillog</span></code> contains information about emails relayed by the local mail server</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</section>
<section id="log-file-rotation">
<h2>Log file rotation</h2>
<p>With the amount of logging that is possible, you need to be able to control the size of log files.</p>
<p>This is done using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">logrotate</span></code> command, which is usually run as a cron job.</p>
<p>The general idea behind the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">logrotate</span></code> command is that log files are periodically backed up, and a new log is started.</p>
<p>Several generations of log are kept, and when a log ages to the last generation, it may be archived/deleted.</p>
</section>
<section id="journalctl">
<h2>Journalctl</h2>
<p>Logs are usually dispersed throughout the system, handled by different daemons and processes, and can be fairly difficult to interpret when they span multiple applications.</p>
<p>Systemd attempts to address these issues by providing a centralized management solution for logging all kernel and userland processes. The system that collects and manages these logs is known as the <strong>journal</strong>.</p>
