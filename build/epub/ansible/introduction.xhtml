<h1>0. Introduction</h1>
<p>Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool that automates infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. It allows you to manage and configure systems, networks, and applications through a simple, human-readable language called YAML.</p>
<p>Ansible uses a push-based model, where a central control node pushes out commands to the managed nodes. The control node communicates with the managed nodes over <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ssh</span></code> and does not require any additional software to be installed on the managed nodes.</p>
<p>Ansible uses a concept called “playbooks” to define and execute automation tasks. A playbook is a YAML file that describes a set of tasks to be executed, along with their dependencies and configuration options. Playbooks can be used to automate tasks such as installing software, configuring services, and deploying applications.</p>
<p>Ansible also provides a large number of pre-built modules that can be used to perform common tasks, such as managing files, users, and services. These modules can be used to automate tasks across a wide variety of systems and platforms, including Linux, Windows, and network devices.</p>
<p>Overall, Ansible is a powerful automation tool that allows you to automate and manage your IT infrastructure in a simple, consistent, and repeatable way. It can help you save time and reduce errors by automating repetitive tasks and ensuring that your systems are configured consistently across your organization.</p>
