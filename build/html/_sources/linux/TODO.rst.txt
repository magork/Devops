#. What does this command ``find / -size +10M -exec ls -l {} \;`` do?

    #. It finds all files using ``ls -l`` and hands them off to the find command to display.
    #. It finds all files older than 10 minutes and long lists them using the ``ls`` command.
    #. It finds all files larger than 10 MB and long lists them using the ``ls`` command.
    #. It uses the ``ls`` command to find all files in the filesystem matching the {} wildcard.

#. Which command will tell you how long a system has been running?

    #. log
    #. uptime
    #. runtime
    #. access

#. Which command in Bash executes the last line in the shell history that starts with ls?

    #. !
    #. !!
    #. !*
    #. !ls

#. Why doesn't ``passwd -l`` keep a user from logging in via other methods?

    #. The passwd command is not used for locking passwords.
    #. There is no password ``-l`` option.
    #. It locks only the password, not the account, so users can still authenticate with keys or other methods.
    #. It does lock the account, keeping users from logging in even if they are using other authentication methods.

#. Why might you use the usermod command?

    #. to log out a user
    #. to lock a user's account
    #. to change global user account settings
    #. to set a user's password

#. With most GNU commands, if an option is a word, what will it be preceded by?

    #. two dashes --
    #. a backslash \
    #. a slash /
    #. one dash -
    #. nothing


7. Which command do you use to rename a file in Linux?

    #. mv
    #. rn
    #. rename
    #. ren

    Some things Man was never meant to know. For everything else, there's Google.
